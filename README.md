# HTML-PHP-Form-Creator

This set of php classes can be used to easily create html forms that have several
validation options depending on the input type.  Form fields can be quickly added
or removed to function as needed.

This set of classes is currently set up to work with Bootstrap templates, but
could be modified to meet the needs of any HTML design.
